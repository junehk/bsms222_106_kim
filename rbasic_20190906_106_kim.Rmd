This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## 3.2 The very basics

Before we get started with the motivating dataset, we need to cover the very basics of R. 

### 3.2.1 Objects

Suppose a high school student asks us for help solving several quadratic equations of the form
$ax^2+bx+c=0$.
The quadratic formula gives us the solutions:
$$
{{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}\over{2a}}
\text{and}
{{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}\over{2a}}
$$

which of course change depending on the values of $a$, $b$ and $c$. One advantage of programming languages is that we can define variables and write expresstions with these variables, similar to how we do so in math, but obtain a numeric solution. We will write out general code for the quadratic equation below, but if we are asked to solve $x^2+x-1=0$, then we define:

~~~{r}
a <- 1
b <- 1
c <- -1
~~~

which stores the values for later use. We use `<-` to assign values to the variables.

We can also assign values using `=` instead of `<-`, but we recommend against using `=` to avoid confusion.

Copy and paste the code above into your console to define the three variables. Note that R does not print anything when we make this assignment. This means the objects were definded successfully. Had you made a mistake, you would have received an error message.

To see the value stored in a variable, we simply ask R to evaulate `a` and it shows the stored value:

~~~{r}
a
#> [1] 1
~~~

A more explicit way to ask R to show us the value stored in `a` is using `print` like this:

~~~{r}
print(a)
#> [1] 1
~~~

We use the term *object* to describe stuff that is stored in R. Variables are examples, but objects can also be more complicated entities such as functions, which are described later.

### 3.2.2 The workspace

As we define objects in the console, we are actually changing the *workspace*. You can see all the variables saved in your workspace by typing:

~~~{r}
ls()
#> [1] "a" "b" "c" "img_path" "murders"
~~~

In RStudio, the *Environment* tab shows the values:

We should see `a`, `b`, and `c`. If you try to recover the value of a variable that is not in your workspace, you receive an err. For example, if you type `x` you will receive the following message: `Error: object 'x' not found`.

Now since these values are saved in variables, to obtain a solution to our equation, we use the quadratic formula:

~~~{r}
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) ) / ( 2*a )
#> [1] 0.618034
(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) ) / ( 2*a )
#> [1] -1.618034
~~~

### 3.2.3 Functions

Once you define variables, the data analysis process can ususally be described as a series of *fuctions* applied to the data. R includes several predefined functions and most of the analysis pipelines we construct make extensive use of these.

We already used the `install.packages`, `library`, and `ls` functions. We also used the function `sqrt` to solve the quadratic eqation above. There are many more prebuilt functions and even more can be added through packages. These functions do noy appear in the workspace because you did not define them, but they are available for immediate use.

In general, we need to use parentheses to evalutate a function. If you type `ls`, the funciton is not evaluated and instead R shows you the code that defines the function. If you type `ls()` the function is evaluated and, as seen above, we see objects in the workspace.

Unlike `ls`most functions require one or more *arguments*. Below is an example of how we assign an object to the argument of thefunciton `log`. Remeber that we earlier defined `a` to be 1:

~~~{r}
log(8)
#> [1] 2.079442
log(a)
#> [1] 0
~~~

You can find out what the function expects and what it does by reviewing the very useful manuals included in R. You can gey help by using the `help` function like this:

~~~{r}
help("log")
~~~

For most functions, we can also use this shorthand:

~~~{r}
?log
~~~

The help page will show you what arguments the function is expecting. For example, `log` needs `x` and `base` to run. However, some arguments are required and others are optional. You cna determine shich arguments are optional by noitng in the help document that a default value is assign with `=`. Defining these is optinal. For example, the base of the function `log` defaults to `base = exp(1)` making `log `the natural log by default.

If you want a quick look at the arguments without opening the help system, you can type:

~~~{r}
args(log)
#> function (x, base = exp(1)) 
#> NULL
~~~

You can change the default values by simply assigning another object:

~~~{r}
log(8, base = 2)
#> [1] 3
~~~

Note that we have not been specifying the argument `x` as such:

~~~{r}
log(x = 8, base = 2)
# [1] 3
~~~

The above code works, but we can save ourselves some typing: if no argument name is used, R assumes you are entering arguments in the order shown in the help file or by `args`. So by not using the names, it assumes the arguments are `x` followed by `base`:

~~~{r}
log(8,2)
#> [1] 3
~~~

If using the arguments' names, then we can include them in whatever order we want:

~~~{r}
log(base = 2, x = 8)
#> [1] 3
~~~

To specify arguments, we must use `=`, and cannot use `<-`.

There are some exceptions to the rule that functions need the parentheses to be evalutaed. Among these, the most commonly used are the arithmetic and relational operators. For example:

~~~{r}
2 ^ 3
#> [1] 8
~~~

You can see the arithmetic operators by typing:

~~~{r}
help("+")
~~~

or

~~~{r}
?"+"
~~~

and the relational operators by typing:

~~~{r}
help(">")
~~~

or

~~~{r}
?">"
~~~

### 3.2.4 Other prebuilt objects

There are several datasets that are inclueded for users to pratice and test out funcitons. You can see all the available datasets by typing:

~~~{r}
data()
~~~

This shows you the object name for these datases. These datasets are objects that can be used by simply typing the name. For example, if you type:

~~~{r}
co2
~~~

R will show you Mauna Loa atmospheric CO2 concentration data.

Other prebuilt objects are mathematical qauntities, such as the constant $\pi$ and $\infty$:

~~~{r}
pi
#> [1] 3.141593
Inf+1
#> [1] Inf
~~~

### 3.2.5 Variable names

We have used the letters `a`, `b` and `c`as variable names, but variable names can be almost anything. Some basic rules in R are that variable names have to start with a letter, can't contain spaces and should not be variables that are predefined in R. For example. don't name one of your variables `install.packages` by typing something like `install.packages <- 2`.

A nice convention to follow is to use meaningful words that describe what is stored, use only lower case, and use underscores as a subtitute for spaces. For the quadratic equation, we could use something like this:

~~~{r}
solution_1 <- (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
solution_2 <- (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
~~~

For more advice, we highly recommend stidying [Hardley Wickham's style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).

### 3.2.6 Saving your workspace

Values remain in the workspace until you end your session or erase them with the function `rm`. But workspaces also can be saved for later use. In fact, when you quit R, the program asks you if you want to asave your workspace. If you do save it, the next time you start R, the program will restore the workspace.

We actually recommend against saving the workspace this way because, as you start working on diffent projects, it will become harder to keep track of what is saved. Instead, we recommnd you assing the workspace a specific name. You can do this by using the function `save` or `save.image`. To load, use the function `load`. When saving a workspace, we recommend the suffix `rda` or `RData`. In RStudio, you can alsodo this by navigating to the *Session* tab and choosing *
Save Workspace as*. You can later load it using the *Load Workspace* options in the same tab. You can read the help pages on `save`, `save.image` and `load` to learn more.

### 3.2.7 Motivating scripts

To solve another equation such as $3x^2 + 2x - 1$, we can copy and paste the code above and then redefine the variables and recompute the solution:

~~~{r}
a <- 3
b <- 2
c <- -1
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
~~~

By creating and saving a script with the code above, we would not need to retype everything each time and, instead, simply change the variable names. Try writing the script above into an editor and notice how easy it is to change the varialbes and receive an answer.

### 3.2.8 Commenting your code

If a line of R code starts with the symbol `#`, it is not evaluted. We can use this write reminders of why we wrote particular code. Forexmaple, in the script above we could add:

~~~{r}
## Code to compute solution to quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c
## define the variables
a <- 3
b <- 2
c <- -1

## now compute the solution
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
~~~

## 3.3 Exercises

1. What is the sum of the first 100 positive integers? The formular for the sum of integers $1$ through $n$ is $n(n + 1) / 2$. Define $n = 100$ and then use R to compute the sum of $1$ through $100$ using the formula. What is the sum?

2. Now use the same formula to compute the sum of the integers from 1 through 1,000.

3. Look at the result of typing the following code into R:

~~~{r}
n <- 1000
x <- seq(1, n)
sum(x)
~~~

Based on the result, what do you think the functions `seq` and `sum` do? You can use the `hlep` system:

A. `sum` creates a list of numbers and `seq` adds them up.

B. `seq` creates a list of numbers and `sum` adds them up.

C. `seq` computes the difference between two arguments and `sum` computes the sum of 1 through 1000.

D. `sum` always returns the same number.

4. In math and programming, we say that we evaluate a function when we replace the argument with a given number. So if we type `sqrt(4)`, we evalutate the `sqrt` function. In R, you can evaluate a function inside another function. The evaluations happen from the inside out.
